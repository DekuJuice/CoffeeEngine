# Coffee Engine

Coffee Engine is a Godot inspired editor/engine built ontop of the LÃ–VE2D
framework.

It uses a [scene and node paradigm](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.html) 
very similar to Godot, and currently features:

- Editable scenes with saving/loading
- Inherited and instanced scenes
- Undo/redo
- Signal editor
- Animation editor
- Tileset and Tilemap editor
- A platformer oriented physics implementation

This engine was created mostly for personal use, but if you have any questions 
regarding usage or the current limitations of the engine/editor then feel free 
to contact me.
